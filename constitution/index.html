            The Constitution was written in the summer of 1787 in Philadelphia,
            Pennsylvania, by delegates from 12 states, in order to replace the
            Articles of Confederation with a new form of government. It created
            a federal system with a national government composed of 3 separated
            powers, and included both reserved and concurrent powers of states.
            It also included a system of checks and balances, and a process for
            amending the Constitution. The Constitution was ratified by 9 out of
            13 states on June 21, 1788. The Constitution is the oldest and
            shortest written Constitution of any major government in the world.
