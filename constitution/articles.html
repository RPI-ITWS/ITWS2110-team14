            The first article of the Constitution affects us today in a very direct way. By defining the manner in which Congress and the House of Representatives are organized, convened, elected and dismissed - and the method by which they must decide upon the law - Article 1 of the Constitution dedicates how a large portion of our government functions. 

            It determines the requirements to impeach or expel a member of the body, the majority required for a law to pass, and allows each state’s legislature to choose the manner in which their representatives and senators are elected.
            
            In determining such factors, it could be said that Article1 of the Constitution is directly responsible for the fact that a given party can “control” either body by having even a slight majority, a polarizing - and in my view dangerous - reality.
            
            However, Article 1 is not entirely bad. It also prevents people from being imprisoned without a proper court hearing and prevents a person from being tried for something they did in the past if it was not illegal when they did it.
