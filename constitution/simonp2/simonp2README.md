Conflicts:

1) Having problems trying to get the page not to scroll side to side, going to leave it alone until later. Just really annoying to look at but not a big deal in the moment.

2) The dropdown was having problems using only HTML, decided as a group that we will use JavaScript instead. Due to this, we have changed the dropdown to a paragraph and now the text isn't center with the screen. This sounds like a silly conflict that I don't know the answer to, as it is something that we went over in Intro. I will get back to the conflict later. 

3) It seems that the github is updating slowly, according to both Anish and I's Github's we are both updated to date but Anish's code is way far behind mind, with the dropdown still in HTML instead of JavaScript.


Solutions:

1)

2)

3) There was a save conflict as both Alex and I were editing and pushing off of the same HTML document. After merging our changes, the document is working fine, the CSS is a little screwed up right now but nothing we can't fix.
