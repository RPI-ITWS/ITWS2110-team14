Issues:

1.  How to create a box like visual for each sub section (a specific amendment, article, etc)
    a) Due to padding (I believe) the background color for a "box" follows from where it is from the far left
    b) How to have text within the box follow the size constraints in proper format
    c) Partially fixed this issue. Got the box like visual, but need to find a way for the text to follow the box.
    d) Text even with scroll/auto still went outside of box
    e) Anish has created a js file that represents/creates objects for each box/card. I will now try to add whatever formatting necessary to this new method.

2.  How to fix hide/showText javaScript
    a) Alex fixed it through adding a p "tag" after the class name (although I did the same prior with no results)

3.  How to create a navbar element dropdown
    a) Will utilize on hover property
    b) Was not able to complete despite w3schools influence as of 09/11/23

4.  Figure out how to hide text on load

5.  NavBar elements displayed vertically
    a) Multiple mistakes: Submenu elements were moving all navabar elements, changing to a ul/li format without formatting with inline, causes it to naturally follow a vertical display

6.  Centering elements in navbar
    a) Used margin-left: 20% to push it leftwards, worked perfectly

7.  Generally, a lot of version control answers between Alex and I.
    Since we were working on the same files with different versions, it was chaotic. However, we figured it out
    and were able to fix/fill in the applications basics.
