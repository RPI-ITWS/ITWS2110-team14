Created some basic files and brainstormed site layout with my team.

Began the process of picking some fitting colors for the site.

I used https://www.staffordschools.net/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=26574&dataid=17977&FileName=US-Constitution-in-Simple-English-updated.pdf and https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-1/

Completed all analysis for Articles and Amendments - waiting on technicals to upload to site.

Uploaded analyses to site and fixed an issue where "read more" would cause the screen to reload to the top of the page.

Our unique cs and js are dropdown cards!
