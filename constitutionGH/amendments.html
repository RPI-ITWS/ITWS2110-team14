            <br /><strong>Analysis:</strong><br /><br />
            The First Amendment is arguably one of the most important. It
            protects our basic freedoms - such as freedom of religion, speech,
            the press, to assemble, and such.
            <br /><br />
            This Amendment impacts us heavily today. A large portion of our
            society revolves around having these basic freedoms.
            <br /><br />
            The freedom to assemble for a cause is often used to voice the
            opinion of the people when they are displeased. You can say (almost)
            whatever you want without the government silencing you.
            <br /><br />
            The basic freedoms given to us by the First Amendment are
            cornerstones of our modern American society.

            <br /><br /><strong>Amendment:</strong><br /><br />
            Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
            or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom
            of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
            assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of
            grievances.

          <strong>Summary:</strong> Amendment 2 grants the right to bear arms
          and keep a well regulated militia.<br /><br />

          <div class="amendment2Text">
            <br /><strong>Analysis:</strong><br /><br />
            The Second Amendment pertains to a “well regulated militia” and the
            right to bear arms. It is arguably one of the most controversial
            Amendments in the modern day.
            <br /><br />
            The interpretation of the Second Amendment has been argued over for
            a long time, and still is today. It is the source of heated debates
            about gun control, and whether it is constitutional.
            <br /><br />
            Whatever your opinion may be about the Second Amendment and gun
            control, it is impossible to ignore the impact it has on our lives
            today.

            <br /><br /><strong>Amendment:</strong><br /><br />
            A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
            State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
            infringed.

          <strong>Summary:</strong> Amendment 3 prevents soldiers from being
          unlawfully housed by the people.<br /><br />
          <a class="hideTextAm3">Read More</a>
          <div class="amendment3Text">
            <br /><strong>Analysis:</strong><br /><br />
            The Third Amendment essentially disallows soldiers to occupy the
            homes of the people without their consent.
            <br /><br />
            This Amendment was specifically created due to the actions of
            British forces during the fight for American independence.
            <br /><br />
            Given that the United States has not had another civil war, nor been
            required to fend off an invasion in recent times, this Amendment
            does not really affect the modern American citizen.

            <br /><br /><strong>Amendment:</strong><br /><br />
            No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house,
            without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a
            manner to be prescribed by law.

          <strong>Summary:</strong> Amendment 4 protects from unreasonable
          searches and siezures. <br /><br />

          <div class="amendment4Text">
            <br /><strong>Analysis:</strong><br /><br />
            The Fourth Amendment protects you from unreasonable searches and or
            seizures - and that no warrant for searches and or seizures shall be
            issued without probable cause.
            <br /><br />
            This Amendment is also extremely important. It offers privacy to
            citizens in many of their affairs, and, in a way, protects them from
            unjust investigations.
            <br /><br />
            The Fourth Amendment is a key element of how our justice system
            operates, and is therefore impactful to our lives today.

            <br /><br /><strong>Amendment:</strong><br /><br />
            The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
            papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,
            shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon
            probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly
            describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
            seized.

          <h1 id="amendment5">Amendment 5</h1>
          <strong>Summary:</strong> Amendment 5 grants the right to silence and
          due process.<br /><br />
          <a class="hideTextAm5">Read More</a>
          <div class="amendment5Text">
            <br /><strong>Analysis:</strong><br /><br />
            The Fifth Amendment is the source of the phrase “pleading the
            fifth”. It means that you can not be forced to be a witness against
            yourself - it gives you the right to say nothing. It is also the
            source of “double jeopardy”, a somewhat niche statement that
            prevents you from being tried again for the same crime if you were
            declared innocent of the crime in a prior trial.
            <br /><br />
            Importantly, it also grants the right to due process. Everyone has
            the right to a trial. Also importantly, it asserts the government
            can not take your property without just compensation.
            <br /><br />
            The Fifth Amendment is another key piece of how our legal system
            operates - and if important in our modern lives as a result.

            <br /><br /><strong>Amendment:</strong><br /><br />
            No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise
            infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand
            Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the
            Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor
            shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in
            jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal
            case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life,
            liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private
            property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

          <strong>Summary:</strong> Amendment 6 sets requirements for criminal
          trials. <br /><br />
          <a class="hideTextAm6">Read More</a>
          <div class="amendment6Text">
            <br /><strong>Analysis:</strong><br /><br />
            The Sixth Amendment guarantees that in any trial, the accused is
            entitled to several things - such as an impartial jury, a public
            defender, and a public trial.
            <br /><br />
            This is again, a key piece of our justice system. It enables people
            to have a chance to defend themselves against a potentially false
            accusation.

            <br /><br /><strong>Amendment:</strong><br /><br />
            In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a
            speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and
            district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district
            shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of
            the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the
            witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining
            witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for
            his defence.

          <div class="amendment7Text">
            <br /><strong>Analysis:</strong><br /><br />
            The Seventh Amendment states that cases where the value owed by one
            party exceeds 20 dollars have the right to be seen before a jury in
            a proper trial.
            <br /><br />
            This Amendment provides an outlet for “civil suits” - or disputes
            between people or similar entities.
            <br /><br />
            Again, this Amendment proves to be a fairly important part of our
            legal system - affecting us to this day.

            <br /><br /><strong>Amendment:</strong><br /><br />
            n Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed
            twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and
            no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court
            of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.

          <div class="amendment8Text">
            <br /><strong>Analysis:</strong><br /><br />
            The Eighth Amendment is protection from excessive fines, bail, and
            from cruel and unusual punishments.
            <br /><br />
            This Amendment prevents a person from being hit with monetary
            punishment or bail in excess of what should actually be given -
            essentially from overly harsh punishments.
            <br /><br />
            Similarly, it protects from cruel and unusual punishments. Note,
            however, that the punishment must be both cruel and unusual to be
            protected against by the Eighth Amendment - a source of some
            controversy.
            <br /><br />
            In the end, this Amendment is fairly important and impactful in the
            modern day when it comes to the results of court cases - criminal or
            otherwise.

            <br /><br /><strong>Amendment:</strong><br /><br />
            Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed,
            nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.

          <h1 id="amendment9">Amendment 9</h1>
          <strong>Summary:</strong> Amendment 9 clarifies that there are rights
          not listed in the Constitution. <br /><br />
          <a class="hideTextAm9">Read More</a>
          <div class="amendment9Text">
            <br /><strong>Summary:</strong><br /><br />
            The Ninth Amendment states that people have rights that are not only
            the ones given to them in the Constitution.
            <br /><br />
            Essentially, it means that while there are rights given by the
            Constitution, they are not the only rights that could exist, and
            should not be treated as such.
            <br /><br />
            Over time, the Supreme Court has found several rights that fall
            under this category - existent but not specifically listed in the
            Constitution - and several of them are incredibly important,
            including the right to vote.
            <br /><br />
            Because this allows new rights to be brought up and recognized, and
            therefore allows our laws and society to change, it is extremely
            important and impactful, especially in our lives today - a time of
            great change in the world.

            <br /><br /><strong>Amendment:</strong><br /><br />
            The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
            construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

          <div class="amendment10Text">
            <br /><strong>Analysis:</strong><br /><br />
            The Tenth Amendment states that the federal government only has the
            powers given to it listed in the Constitution - and that any other
            powers are vested in either the States or the people.
            <br /><br />
            This essentially gives states the ability to create their own laws
            that apply to them, while still needing to respect the laws of the
            federal government. These state level laws are extremely important
            in our modern society - and people even chose where to live based on
            them.
            <br /><br />
            The laws passed at the state level have been the sources of
            controversy in recent times, such as laws regarding abortion.
            <br /><br />
            Given all of the effects state level laws can have on us, the Tenth
            Amendment is extremely impactful to us today.

            <br /><br /><strong>Amendment:</strong><br /><br />
            The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
            nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
            respectively, or to the people.
