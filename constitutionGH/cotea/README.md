There were a number of things that I got suck on in this lab
One of them was the nav bar. This thing sucked. I did figure out tho that
to get the hover drop down functionality using an un ordered list was best to get the
<a> in the code

Another thing is team communication. There were a number of things that we could have
talked about better. Most of the times someone would make a change that would over write
something that someone else did. Now knowing the proper workflow of things this wont happen,
but it was jsut a note. As a team we will get better at working together. These bigger projects 
are good at helping us do that. 

I spent a lot of time on this project, and over all I am happy with how it turned out. I am not too
proud of the javascript that I wrote. It was very repetitive and I am sure there is a better way
to do that. It had just gotten late and I didnt't feel like changing something that wasn't
functionally broken. Though it does look horendous.

For grading on the creativity, I don't really know what to say here, but I do think the color scheme that
we have is nice. It was an american theme to it that isnt too crazy. Also Anish's implementaion of the
custom cards was a nice touch. Those gave the website a bit more of a polish in the end.
