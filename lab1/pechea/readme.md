Lab 1

Created personal VM, at pechearpi642031.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com

Created iit folder, and added myself as a user. Also created accounts for teacher and TA, listed below.

Username:           Password:
callahan            Cal~!723&wSd

Began the process of hooking up my VM to Github. Got stuck at the SSH key. The command "ls -la /var/www/.ssh" didn't show the file the document said it should.

Turn out I had created it incorrectly - which I fixed with help.

Created SSH keys and linked it to GitHub. Also connected it to github desktop.

After all that, I began to to work on my group site portfolio.

I imported a picture from my phone, moved this readme file to the group site from the spot I made it originally, and began to think of how I wanted my page to look.

Additionally, I created our team's logo (which is, of course, subject to change) - and our slogan "Why not buy and sell?".

Created a custom image class for my picture on my personal porfolio, and began to make my info section.

Used this tutorial https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_email_links.htm to figure out email links.

I began the process of laying out my divs as I wanted them, and began with my personal information. It wasn't hard by itself,
but it did take some work to get it and the image lined up and looking how I wanted it.

The other sections were simply, using a similar strucutre to what I used before.

The exception to this simplicity was the "experience" section, which is not cooperating and lining up despite its div having the same class.

After fiddling with it and reviewing the css sheet, I realized that because I had copied the navbar initially, and used the same tag
"#achievementsAndExperience" as the index, it was behaving differently. I simply changed the tag.

Finished fabricating job experiences, and added a joke to the links for the companes that (probably, but I am not 100% sure) don't exist.

Met with group to research hCard. Used this source, and the template code, which I modified with the proper informaiton:
