Lab 1

Created personal VM, at pechearpi642031.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com

Created iit folder, and added myself as a user. Also created accounts for teacher and TA, listed below.

Username:           Password:
callahan            Cal~!723&wSd
glorianwachukwu     glw&ast23!@v

Began the process of hooking up my VM to Github. Got stuck at the SSH key. The command "ls -la /var/www/.ssh" didn't show the file the document said it should.

Turn out I had created it incorrectly - which I fixed with help.

Created SSH keys and linked it to GitHub. Also connected it to github desktop.

After all that, I began to to work on my group site portfolio.

I imported a picture from my phone, moved this readme file to the group site from the spot I made it originally, and began to think of how I wanted my page to look.

Additionally, I created our team's logo (which is, of course, subject to change) - and our slogan "Why not buy and sell?".

Created a custom image class for my picture on my personal porfolio, and began to make my info section.

Used this tutorial https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_email_links.htm to figure out email links.
