Lab 1

Created personal VM, at pechearpi642031.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com

Created iit folder, and added myself as a user. Also created accounts for teacher and TA, listed below.

Username:           Password:
callahan            Cal~!723&wSd
glorianwachukwu     glw&ast23!@v

Began the process of hooking up my VM to Github. Got stuck at the SSH key. The command "ls -la /var/www/.ssh" didn't show the file the document said it should.

Turn out I had created it incorrectly - which I fixed with help.

Created SSH keys and linked it to GitHub. Also connected it to github desktop.
