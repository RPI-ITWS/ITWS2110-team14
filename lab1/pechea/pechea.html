         Introduction
         </h1>
         <p>
            I am a second year student at RPI, my major is Information Technology and Web Science, on the Information Management 
            Systems focus track. I aim to develop my skills as both a programmer and a leader. While I might not be the best 
            programmer now, and may never be, I want to be able to understand enough that I can manage and discuss work with a
            group of more competent programmers.

            <p> 2022 - 2026 (Though I may extend my stay)</p>

            <p> 2020 - 2022 </p>
            <p> CCHS was actually the second high school which I attended - due to the fact that my family moved
               in the middle of my schooling. 
            </p>
            <p> Among my accomplishments at CCHS, include being a Teaching Assistant for the coding teacher, and graduating
               with a GPA that was very close to 4.0, but had around 6 decimal places.

         <p> Summer 2023 - 6/12 to 8/23 </p>
         <p> Essentially a summer job, where I didn't do anything particularly special. I did, however,
            gain valuable insight into the inner workings of the medical world and the technology behind it
            that could serve me later in my professional life.
