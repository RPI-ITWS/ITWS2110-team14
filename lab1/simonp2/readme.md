Conflicts and Additions:
-Adding the footer was nice but also let to some annoying HTML validation problems, I put the footer outside of the body because the header was as well. But when I went to validate, it said it needed to be inside of the body. Messing up some of the styling I made for it in the process. In the end, I'm happy with how the footer ended up as it looks neat and professional

-The photo of Dermagenix is what I believe to not be the final version it ended up being in the end with my group last year. But when I went to get the most recent version of the page, I found that my team's github repo was deleted at the end of the semester last spring. For future versions of the site, I will ask my teammates from Intro to IT if they have a better image of the website we can use.

-I decided to add a right margin to all of the text boxes on both my page and main page, recommending my partners do the same for their personal pages. This was to make the page look neater and to prevent side to side scrolling. I took the left margin value and put it on the right margin in order to keep the text center in the screen.

-I looked back at my profile and resume from last semester and was proud of my improvements I had made over time. The new page looked cleaner with easier to read colors and text. The Green and White color scheme I went for last time does look as nice and organized as the greys and white we went for this time.

-I had a problem trying to get my HTML to validate due to the logo in the top left of the page. I looked everywhere but it seemed the width and height wouldn't validate for some reason. The error said it was reading "p" which puzzled me for a while. I tried deleted and rewriting the line over and over to not avail, believing I had made a typo I wasn't picking up on. I found a website (cited about) which explained that the only thing the image needs is a number, not a % or px at the end. After that, the image stayed the same and validated perfectly.
