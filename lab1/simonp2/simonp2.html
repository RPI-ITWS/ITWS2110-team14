            <p>
               Hi, my name is Peter Simone, I am a student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 
               as a Computer Science & ITWS Dual Major. I have some coding past but I would like
               to use this time to have a formal coding education as I started out by self-teaching 
               myself.
