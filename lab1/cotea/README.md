README file for lab 1 of Web Sys

I created a profile page for myslef on the group website
I hope to add to this page further as the semester goes on,
adding things with the new skills that I learn

Like my about me blurb, I like to learn and I want to add some cool things to it.
Time will tell if I actually get to this, but if I read this file again I should remember

This was a good lab at helping me remember what I learned last semester in Intro.
