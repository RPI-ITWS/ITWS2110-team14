               I am a sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, dual majoring in Computer Science and Information Technology & Web Science. Technology 
               has always interested me, and I try to learn as much as I can about it. I am always looking for new things to learn. I am always trying to get 
               better at collaborating with people because I believe it is the most efficient way to work.
